<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently working as a researcher in Huawei. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Northwestern University, United States in 2021, advised by [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhu-qi.html), and bachelor degree in Microelectronics from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2016.

My research interests include sensor-fusion based indoor localization, autonmous driving and Cyber-Physical Systems. Many of my PhD works have been published in top design automation conferences, including DAC, ICCAD, ICCD. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MgfmJe8AAAAJ'>Check out my google scholar here.<strong><span id='total_cit'></span></strong></a>

[End-to-end Uncertainty-based Mitigation of Adversarial Attacks to Automated Lane Centering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9575549)

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=MgfmJe8AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&authuser=1&citation_for_view=MgfmJe8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- analyzed the impact of dirty road patch attack across the ADAS pipeline, and developed a method to quantitatively measure the perception uncertainty under attack.
- conducted experiments on both public dataset and LGSVL. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the system robustness over the original OpenPilot implementation under adversarial attacks, reducing lateral deviation by 55% ~ 90%.
